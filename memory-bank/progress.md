# Progress: bare-expo

**What Works:**
- The basic `bare-expo` project structure is in place.
- Core memory bank files have been initialized, providing foundational context for the project.
- The `SyntaxError: JSON Parse error: Unexpected character: {` has been addressed by implementing a robust JSON parsing mechanism in `app/index.tsx` that can handle concatenated JSON objects.
- The `crypto.getRandomValues()` not supported error has been resolved by polyfilling `crypto` with `react-native-get-random-values`.
- The app now renders content within `<think>` tags in an expandable button, providing a way to display "thought" processes or metadata without cluttering the main response.
- Markdown formatting has been successfully implemented for user messages, AI responses, and thought content using `marked` and `react-native-render-html`.

**What's Left to Build:**
- A deeper understanding of the `b4a` integration and its role in data handling is required.
- Full functionality of the application, including communication between frontend and backend, needs to be verified.

**Current Status:**
- The critical JSON parsing error and the `crypto.getRandomValues()` error have been mitigated.
- Markdown formatting is now supported across the chat interface.
- The project is now in a more stable state for further development and testing.

**Known Issues:**
- No critical known issues at this moment, but further testing is required to confirm the stability of the JSON parsing fix, the crypto polyfill, and overall application functionality.
- The expandable "thought" button feature is new and may require further UI/UX refinements based on user feedback.
