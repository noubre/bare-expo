# Technical Context: bare-expo

**Technologies Used:**
- **React Native:** For building native mobile applications using JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Expo:** Specifically the bare workflow, providing a managed environment for React Native development while allowing full control over native code.
- **Node.js:** The runtime environment for the backend (`backend.mjs`) and potentially for development tooling.
- **TypeScript:** Indicated by `tsconfig.json` and `.d.ts` files, providing static typing for improved code quality and maintainability.
- **Hypercore/Hyperdrive (b4a):** A low-level data structure for building peer-to-peer applications, likely used for data synchronization and storage.
- **Babel:** `babel.config.js` indicates its use for JavaScript transpilation.
- **Prettier:** `.prettierrc` indicates its use for code formatting.

**Development Setup:**
- **Package Manager:** `package.json` suggests `npm` or `yarn` for dependency management.
- **Transpilation:** Babel is used to transpile modern JavaScript/TypeScript into compatible versions for target environments.
- **Type Checking:** TypeScript is configured for type checking.

**Technical Constraints:**
- **Mobile Platform Specifics:** While React Native aims for cross-platform compatibility, platform-specific nuances (iOS/Android) might require special handling.
- **Performance:** Mobile application performance needs careful consideration, especially with real-time data and potential peer-to-peer networking.
- **Bundle Size:** Keeping the application bundle size optimized is crucial for mobile apps.
- **Hypercore/Hyperdrive Complexity:** Working with low-level data structures like Hypercore can introduce complexity in data modeling and synchronization.

**Dependencies:**
- **`package.json`:** This file lists all project dependencies, including React Native, Expo, and potentially `b4a` or related libraries.
- **`b4a.d.ts`:** Indicates a dependency on the `b4a` library.
