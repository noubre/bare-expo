# System Patterns: bare-expo

**System Architecture:**
The `bare-expo` project appears to follow a client-server architecture, with a React Native frontend (`app/index.tsx`) and a Node.js backend (`backend/backend.mjs`). The presence of `b4a.d.ts` suggests the use of Hypercore/Hyperdrive for data storage and synchronization, implying a potential peer-to-peer or distributed data pattern alongside the traditional client-server model.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **React Native (Expo Bare Workflow):** Chosen for cross-platform mobile development, offering native capabilities with JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Node.js Backend:** For server-side logic and potentially acting as a gateway or signaling server for peer-to-peer connections.
- **Hypercore/Hyperdrive (b4a):** Implies a decision to use a append-only log or distributed file system for data, which is suitable for real-time, offline-first, and collaborative applications. This suggests a focus on data integrity, versioning, and peer-to-peer data sharing.

**Design Patterns in Use:**
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Given the nature of real-time communication and potential peer-to-peer interactions, an event-driven pattern is likely used for handling data updates and messages.
- **Module Pattern:** The use of `.mjs` files for backend and RPC commands suggests a modular approach to code organization.
- **Component-Based UI (React Native):** Standard for React Native applications, promoting reusability and maintainability of UI elements.

**Component Relationships:**
- **`app/index.tsx` (Frontend):** The main entry point for the mobile application. It likely interacts with the backend and potentially directly with Hypercore/Hyperdrive for data.
- **`backend/backend.mjs` (Backend):** Handles server-side logic, API endpoints, and potentially manages Hypercore/Hyperdrive instances or acts as a peer in the network.
- **`rpc-commands.mjs`:** Likely defines the remote procedure calls (RPC) that the frontend can invoke on the backend, or vice-versa, facilitating communication between the client and server.
- **`b4a.d.ts`:** Type definitions for the `b4a` library, indicating its integration into the project for data management.
