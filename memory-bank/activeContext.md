# Active Context: bare-expo

**Current Work Focus:**
The immediate focus is to address the `SyntaxError: JSON Parse error: Unexpected character: {` reported in the console logs. This error indicates an issue with how JSON data is being received or parsed within the application.

**Recent Changes:**
- No recent code changes have been made by the agent.
- Memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`) have been created to establish project context.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Investigate the source of the malformed JSON. The console log shows a byte array `[123, 34, 116, 121, 112, 101, 34, 58, 34, 109, 111, 100, 101, 95, 117, 112, 100, 97, 116, 101, 34, 44, 34, 105, 115, 67, 111, 108, 108, 97, 98, 111, 114, 97, 116, 105, 118, 101, 77, 111, 100, 101, 34, 58, 102, 97, 108, 115, 101, 125, 123, 34, 116, 121, 112, 101, 34, 58, 34, 104, 97, 110, 100, 115, 104, 97, 107, 101, 95, 97, 99, 107, 34, 44, 34, 115, 101, 114, 118, 101, 114, 73, 100, 34, 58, 34, 98, 52, 54, 50, 97, 57, 99, 56, 49, 52, 57, 51, 53, 101, 52, 52, 57, 100, 98, 51, 53, 99, 98, 97, 52, 97, 101, 57, 101, 98, 48, 98, 54, 100, 48, 97, 54, 50, 97, 53, 54, 52, 50, 57, 56, 55, 53, 102, 48, 56, 55, 99, 52, 57, 50, 51, 48, 53, 52, 53, 97, 52, 49, 50, 54, 34, 44, 34, 116, 105, 109, 101, 115, 116, 97, 109, 112, 34, 58, 49, 55, 53, 50, 52, 55, 50, 55, 57, 52, 53, 57, 49, 125]` which, when decoded, appears to be two concatenated JSON objects: `{"type":"mode_update","isCollaborativeMode":false}{"type":"handshake_ack","serverId":"b4629c814935e449db35cba4ae9eb0b6d0a62a56429875f087c49230545a4126","timestamp":1752472794591}`. This is the root cause of the `Unexpected character: {` error.
2.  Identify the code responsible for receiving and parsing this data.
3.  Implement a fix to ensure that multiple JSON objects are handled correctly, either by parsing them individually or ensuring they are sent as a valid JSON array or stream.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
- The error suggests that the application is receiving multiple JSON objects concatenated without a separator (like a comma for an array) or proper streaming.
- The `backend/backend.mjs` and `rpc-commands.mjs` files are likely candidates for where this data is being sent from or received.
- The `app/index.tsx` file is the main entry point for the React Native application and would be where the parsing logic might reside or be called.
