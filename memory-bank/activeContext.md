# Active Context: bare-expo

**Current Work Focus:**
The primary focus has been on modernizing the application's UI and implementing a theme-switching capability. This involved a significant refactoring of the styling to support dynamic themes (light and dark) and persisting the user's choice.

**Recent Changes:**
- **Theming System:**
  - Created `app/styles/themes.ts` to define `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` color palettes and style properties.
  - Implemented `app/styles/themeContext.tsx`, which provides a `ThemeProvider` and a `useTheme` hook to make the theme accessible throughout the application.
  - Installed `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` to persist the selected theme.
- **UI Refactoring:**
  - Refactored `app/index.tsx` to use the new theming system. All hardcoded styles have been replaced with dynamic values from the theme context.
  - Wrapped the main application component in `ThemeProvider` to enable theme switching.
- **Theme Switcher:**
  - Added a `Switch` component to the header in `app/index.tsx` to allow users to toggle between light and dark modes.

**Next Steps:**
- Verify the implementation by running the application and testing the theme switcher.
- Update the `progress.md` file to reflect the completion of this task.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
- The decision to use `AsyncStorage` for theme persistence ensures a consistent user experience across app sessions.
- The styling is now more maintainable and scalable due to the centralized theme management.
