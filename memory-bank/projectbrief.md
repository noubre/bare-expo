# Project Brief: bare-expo

This project, `bare-expo`, appears to be a bare React Native Expo project. It likely serves as a foundation for mobile application development using Expo's bare workflow.

**Core Requirements:**
- To provide a functional and extensible base for a React Native application.
- To integrate with a backend system, as indicated by the `backend/backend.mjs` file.
- To handle real-time data or communication, potentially using a peer-to-peer or distributed system, given the presence of `b4a.d.ts` (likely related to `hypercore-protocol` or `beaker-for-anything`).

**Goals:**
- Ensure the project is set up correctly for development and deployment.
- Facilitate seamless communication between the frontend (React Native) and the backend.
- Resolve any existing errors or issues, such as the JSON parsing error reported.
- Potentially implement new features or extend existing functionalities as required by future tasks.
