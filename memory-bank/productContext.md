# Product Context: bare-expo

**Purpose:**
The `bare-expo` project aims to provide a robust and flexible mobile application framework. It is designed to be a starting point for various mobile applications that may require real-time data synchronization and peer-to-peer capabilities.

**Problems Solved:**
- Provides a pre-configured React Native environment, reducing initial setup time.
- Offers a foundation for integrating with a custom backend, allowing for specialized application logic.
- Potentially addresses challenges related to decentralized data management and real-time collaboration through its use of `b4a` (Hypercore/Hyperdrive related technologies).

**How it Should Work:**
- The mobile application should run smoothly on both iOS and Android platforms.
- It should communicate effectively with the `backend.mjs` service for data operations.
- The application should be responsive and provide a good user experience.
- Data integrity and consistency should be maintained, especially with real-time updates.

**User Experience Goals:**
- **Intuitive Interface:** Users should find the application easy to navigate and understand.
- **Fast Performance:** The application should load quickly and respond promptly to user interactions.
- **Reliable Data:** Users should trust that the data displayed is accurate and up-to-date.
- **Seamless Collaboration (if applicable):** If collaborative features are implemented, they should work without friction.
